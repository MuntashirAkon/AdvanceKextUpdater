  "changes": "#### v2.2.2\n- Fixes a problem which may cause trouble when trying to change the MAC address.\n- Optimized for Sierra and High Sierra.",
  "guide": "#### Key Features of the Driver\n- Supports Qualcomm Atheros AR816x, AR817x, Killer E220x, Killer E2400 and Killer E2500.\n- Support for multisegment packets relieving the network stack of unnecessary copy operations when assembling packets for transmission.\n- No-copy receive and transmit. Only small packets are copied on reception because creating a copy is more efficient than allocating a new buffer.\n- TCP, UDP and IPv4 checksum offload (receive and transmit).\n- Support for TCP/IPv6 and UDP/IPv6 checksum offload.\n- Makes use of the chip's TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) feature with IPv4 and IPv6 in order to reduce CPU load while sending large amounts of data.\n- Fully optimized for Mountain Lion, Mavericks and Yosemite (64bit architecture) but version 1.x.x should work with Lion too, provided you build from source with the 10.7 SDK.\n- Wake on LAN support.\n- VLAN support is implemented but untested as I have no need for it.\n- Supports Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE).\n- Supports jumbo frames up to 9000 bytes.",
